# WeatherApp 

Dan Beladev - danbeladev@gmail.com - *Home Assignment - Herolo*

This app is written with React and it simulates a weather indication around the world

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Run the project from the `Dan-Beladev-27-05-2020` repository:

```
npm install
npm start
```



The web application should now run locally on port 3000.

You can access it from the browser via: `http://localhost:3000`

Due to cors issues, the browser must accept "unsafe content" because a site is running in 'https' protocol and we are requesting information from api with 'http' protocol.
