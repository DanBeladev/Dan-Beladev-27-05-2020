This app is written with React and it simulates a weather indication around the world

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

This app has been uploaded to Heroku's server, you can log in and watch it by clicking the link:
`https://weather-api-website-dan.herokuapp.com/`


### Prerequisites

Run the project from the `World-Weather-App` repository:

```
npm install
npm start
```



The web application should now run locally on port 3000.

You can access it from the browser via: `http://localhost:3000`

Due to cors issues, the browser must accept "unsafe content" because a site is running in 'https' protocol and we are requesting information from api with 'http' protocol.
